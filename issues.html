<h1 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">All of the problems with me.</h1>
<hr>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Pectus Excavatum</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">I suffer from this very amazing thing called pectus excavatum where my chest looks like I got hit by a cannonball, this basically means any prolonged exercise makes me feel like I have been running since the dawn of man and I have very poor stamina regeneration. I also get random tightness, lack of breath, and back pain! It's a birth defect by the way so I was born ugly! Very cool!</p>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Disfigured Back/Spine</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">If you have ever looked at me ever, you might notice my back does this really cool thing where it bends and I look weird. This also causes massive amounts of back pain, as well as other issues as well! Very cool!</p>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Too high of a metabolism</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Now, having a high metabolism is good, but mine is TOO HIGH. I can down ungodly amounts of fatty food and not gain a singular pound, sometimes the day after, I have LOST WEIGHT. So whats so bad about this? I am always hungry, I eat food, it passes through me. I tend to try to eat less and ignore hunger to try and not be a skinny glutton but its really hard when hunger is somehow worse tha pain itself.</p>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Enemal Erosion</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">During COVID, I drank ungodly amounts of soda. The consequences of this has led to irreversible enemal erosion. My teeth now hurt all the time, I grind, I get random toothaches for no reason. I brush my teeth daily and use mouthwash but that still doesnt do anything, in fact, it makes it hurt more because my teeth are extremely sensitive now. Very cool!</p>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Fatigue</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">No idea why it happens, but I have an issue where I am always tired. I am drowsy making this code and I slept for 5 hours last night. I can get 12 hours of sleep, and be tired the entire day. What causes it? I dunno. Why don't I go to a doctor? They will tell me to get more sleep and I dont feel like wasting money on that.</p>
<h2 class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">Go to a doctor?</h2>
<p class="hellopleasealignformeThanks fonttextlookgoodThanks">too much money sorry and what are they gonna do</p>
